# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Software
My tests with several boards based on RP2040 or RP2350. 

Here you will find several tests which requires a RP2040 or RP2350 based board
and additional components like display or sensor.
I try to use [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) when 
possible. As an IDE I prefer [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

Boards in use:

- Original Raspberry Pi Pico (W)
- Original Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
- RP2040 TYPE-C (compatible board with 16MB and a RBG WS2812 LED)
